# Firestore Sync Implementation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the Firestore synchronization system for ResumeForge, which enables seamless multi-device resume management with offline support.

## Features Implemented

### âœ… Core Features

1. **Offline-First Architecture**
   - Build resumes without internet connection
   - Changes are queued and synced when back online
   - Auto-sync every 5 seconds when online

2. **Pre-Login Resume Preservation**
   - Create resumes before signing in
   - Automatically upload to Firestore when user logs in
   - Merge with existing cloud resumes using last-write-wins

3. **Real-Time Sync for Logged-In Users**
   - Auto-save to Firestore (debounced 1 second)
   - Sync status indicators in UI
   - Background sync queue for failed operations

4. **Multi-Resume Management**
   - Create, update, and delete multiple resumes
   - 3 free resumes per user limit
   - Cross-device synchronization

5. **Conflict Resolution**
   - Last-write-wins strategy (simpler and more predictable)
   - Compares timestamps to determine which version to keep

6. **Sync Status Indicators**
   - Online/Offline status
   - Syncing progress
   - Last synced timestamp on each resume
   - Pending changes count

## Architecture

### File Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ firestore.service.js    # Firestore CRUD operations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sync.service.js          # Offline queue & sync logic
â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ useResumeSync.js         # React hook for sync status
â”œâ”€â”€ contexts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ResumeContext.jsx        # Updated with Firestore sync
â””â”€â”€ pages/
    â”œâ”€â”€ HomePage.jsx             # Sync on login/logout
    â””â”€â”€ new_resume/
        â””â”€â”€ StashPanel.jsx       # Sync status UI
```

### Data Flow

```
User Action
    â†“
ResumeContext (updates state)
    â†“
localStorage (immediate save)
    â†“
Sync Service (queue operation)
    â†“
Firestore (when online)
```

## Firestore Data Structure

### Collection: `resumes`

```javascript
{
  id: string,                    // Local resume ID
  userId: string,                // Firebase user UID
  name: string,                  // Resume name
  data: {                        // Full resume data
    basics: {...},
    experience: [...],
    education: [...],
    // ... all resume sections
  },
  createdAt: Timestamp,          // Creation time
  updatedAt: Timestamp,          // Last update time
  lastSyncedAt: Timestamp,       // Last sync time
  syncStatus: string             // 'synced' | 'pending' | 'error'
}
```

## Key Components

### 1. Firestore Service (`firestore.service.js`)

Handles all Firestore operations:

- `getUserResumes(userId)` - Get all resumes for a user
- `getResume(resumeId)` - Get a single resume
- `saveResume(userId, resume)` - Create or update a resume
- `deleteResume(resumeId)` - Delete a resume
- `syncLocalResumes(userId, localResumes)` - Sync local resumes on login
- `canCreateResume(userId)` - Check if user can create more resumes
- `getResumeCount(userId)` - Get user's resume count

**Resume Limit:** 3 free resumes per user (configurable via `MAX_FREE_RESUMES`)

### 2. Sync Service (`sync.service.js`)

Manages offline operations and sync queue:

- Listens for online/offline events
- Queues operations when offline
- Auto-syncs when back online
- Retries failed operations
- Notifies listeners of sync events

**Sync Events:**
- `online` - Device came back online
- `offline` - Device went offline
- `sync_start` - Sync process started
- `sync_complete` - Sync process completed
- `queued` - Operation added to queue
- `queue_cleared` - Queue was cleared

### 3. Resume Sync Hook (`useResumeSync.js`)

React hook for accessing sync status:

```javascript
const { isOnline, isSyncing, pendingCount, lastSyncEvent } = useResumeSync();
```

### 4. Updated Resume Context

Now includes Firestore sync:
- Auto-saves to localStorage (1 second debounce)
- Queues sync to Firestore if user is logged in
- Updates resume list with latest data

## User Flows

### Flow 1: New User Creates Resume (Not Logged In)

1. User creates resume â†’ Saved to localStorage
2. User continues editing â†’ Auto-saved locally
3. User signs in â†’ All local resumes uploaded to Firestore
4. Future edits â†’ Auto-synced to Firestore

### Flow 2: Existing User Creates Resume (Logged In)

1. Check resume limit (3 free resumes)
2. If under limit â†’ Create resume
3. Save to localStorage
4. Queue sync to Firestore
5. Sync immediately if online, or queue if offline

### Flow 3: User Edits Resume While Offline

1. User edits resume â†’ Saved to localStorage
2. Sync operation queued
3. UI shows "Offline" status
4. When back online â†’ Auto-sync queued operations
5. UI shows "Synced" status

### Flow 4: User Logs In on New Device

1. User signs in
2. Download all cloud resumes
3. Merge with any local resumes (if any)
4. Use last-write-wins for conflicts
5. Update local storage with merged resumes

### Flow 5: User Deletes Resume

1. Delete from local storage
2. Update UI immediately
3. Queue delete operation for Firestore
4. Sync when online

## Sync Status Indicators

### In Stash Panel Header

- ðŸŸ¢ **Synced** - All changes saved to cloud
- ðŸ”µ **Syncing...** - Currently uploading changes
- ðŸŸ¡ **Offline** - No internet connection
- ðŸŸ  **X pending** - X operations waiting to sync

### On Each Resume Card

- **Updated:** Last local update time
- **Synced:** Last successful sync to Firestore
- **Not synced (limit reached):** Resume not synced due to limit

## Configuration

### Resume Limit

Change in `src/services/firestore.service.js`:

```javascript
const MAX_FREE_RESUMES = 3; // Change this value
```

### Sync Interval

Change in `src/services/sync.service.js`:

```javascript
const SYNC_INTERVAL = 5000; // 5 seconds (in milliseconds)
```

### Auto-Save Debounce

Change in `src/contexts/ResumeContext.jsx`:

```javascript
debounce((state) => {
  // ...
}, 1000) // 1 second (in milliseconds)
```

## Error Handling

### Resume Limit Reached

When user tries to create more than 3 resumes:
- Show alert with clear message
- Suggest deleting old resumes
- Don't allow creation until under limit

### Sync Failures

- Operations remain in queue
- Retry on next sync cycle
- User can continue working offline
- Changes preserved in localStorage

### Network Errors

- Gracefully handle offline state
- Queue all operations
- Auto-resume when back online
- No data loss

## Testing Checklist

### Offline Functionality
- [ ] Create resume while offline
- [ ] Edit resume while offline
- [ ] Delete resume while offline
- [ ] Go offline mid-edit
- [ ] Come back online and verify sync

### Multi-Device
- [ ] Create resume on Device A
- [ ] Sign in on Device B and verify it appears
- [ ] Edit on Device B
- [ ] Refresh Device A and verify changes

### Resume Limit
- [ ] Create 3 resumes
- [ ] Try to create 4th resume (should fail)
- [ ] Delete one resume
- [ ] Create new resume (should succeed)

### Conflict Resolution
- [ ] Edit same resume on two devices while offline
- [ ] Go online on both
- [ ] Verify last-write-wins

## Troubleshooting

### Resumes Not Syncing

1. Check if user is logged in
2. Check internet connection
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify Firebase configuration in `.env.local`
5. Check Firestore rules in Firebase Console

### Sync Status Stuck on "Syncing..."

1. Check network tab for failed requests
2. Clear sync queue: `syncService.clearQueue()`
3. Refresh page
4. Check Firestore rules

### Resume Limit Not Working

1. Verify `MAX_FREE_RESUMES` constant
2. Check Firestore query results
3. Verify user authentication
4. Check browser console for errors

## Firebase Console Setup

### Firestore Rules

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /resumes/{resumeId} {
      // Users can only read/write their own resumes
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                           request.resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
      
      // Allow user to read their own resumes
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                     resource.data.userId == request.auth.uid;
    }
  }
}
```

### Indexes

Create composite index for:
- Collection: `resumes`
- Fields: `userId` (Ascending), `updatedAt` (Descending)

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check browser console for errors
